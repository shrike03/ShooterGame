  you will also benefit one point.
# Control

  A - moving left
  D - moving right
  LPM - shoot
  R - reset game
  P - pause game
# Project purpose
  Presentation and Demonstration
# Project Objective
  Demonstrating a basic understanding of Python programming by:
    Creating classes and using them in the game code  include game components, including characters, objects, and buttons. 
    Class inheritance through the using of pre-existing classes as a foundation for extending functionalities.
    Organization and segmententing of the code into modules, increasing its transparency, easier manipulation, introducing changes and extension of the project.
    The use of conditional statements and loops for program control.
    Event-driven programming, responding to user input, like key press.
    Visual design, pixel art graphic (e.g.soldier sprite, background), and correct adding it to the game and make animation by using it.
    Constructing game mechanics from scratch, such as: speed, gravity, character movement, collision detection, shooting.
    Optimization of the project, by removing projectiles which are beyond the screen.
    Showcasing fundamental game design principles.
